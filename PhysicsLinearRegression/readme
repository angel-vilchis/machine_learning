this is my own take on a linear regression tutorial from a course on Coursera called DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate

physics kinematics v-t graph at constant acceleration is linear so I thought it'd be cool to try predicting velocity with machine learning's linear regression
