this is my own take on a linear regression tutorial from a course on Coursera called DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate

physics kinematics v-t graph at constant acceleration follows a linear model so I thought it'd be cool to try predicting with machine learning's linear regression
